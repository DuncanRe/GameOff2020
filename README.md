# GameOff2020

This is a game about being stranded on the moon. The goal is to get the parts needed to repair your ship and find it.

This game was a way for me to get some practice in Unity but also entered in the itch.io 2020 Game Off.

Builds for Linux, Mac and Windows can be found in the build folder.

The moon texture was created by Reddit user u/danokablamo.
